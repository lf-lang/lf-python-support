 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Target-specific runtime functions for the Python target language.
 * This API layer can be used in conjunction with:
 *     target Python;
 * 
 * Note for target language developers. This is one way of developing a target language where 
 * the C core runtime is adopted. This file is a translation layer that implements Lingua Franca 
 * APIs which interact with the internal _lf_SET and _lf_schedule APIs. This file can act as a 
 * template for future runtime developement for target languages.
 * For source generation, see xtext/org.icyphy.linguafranca/src/org/icyphy/generator/PythonGenerator.xtend.

 * 
 * First, the void* pointer is stored in a PyCapsule. If the port is not

 * feilds then can be accessed from the Python code as port.value and
 * port.is_present.
 * If the value is absent, it will be set to None.
 * 
 * For multiports, the value of the port_capsule (i.e., port.value) is always
 * set to None and is_present is set to false.
 * Individual ports can then later be accessed in Python code as port[idx].

/**
 * A helper function to convert C actions to Python action capsules
 * @see xtext/org.icyphy.linguafranca/src/org/icyphy/generator/CGenerator.xtend for details about C actions
 * Python actions have the following fields (for more information @see generic_action_capsule_struct):
 *   PyObject_HEAD
 *   PyObject* action;   
 *   PyObject* value; 
 *   bool is_present; 
 *   
 * The input to this function is a pointer to a C action, which might or 
 * might not contain a value and an is_present field. To simplify the assumptions
 * made by this function, the "value" and "is_present" are passed to the function
 * instead of expecting them to exist.
 * 
 * The void* pointer to the C action instance is encapsulated in a PyCapsule instead of passing an exposed pointer through
 * Python. @see https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/capsule.html
 * This encapsulation is done by calling PyCapsule_New(action, "name_of_the_container_in_the_capsule", NULL), 
 * where "name_of_the_container_in_the_capsule" is an agreed-upon container name inside the capsule. This 
 * capsule can then be treated as a PyObject* and safely passed through Python code. On the other end 
 * (which is in schedule functions), PyCapsule_GetPointer(recieved_action,"action") can be called to retrieve 
 * the void* pointer into recieved_action.
